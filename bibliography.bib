	abstract = {This study provides an overview of power consumption models of servers in data centers. The server is the basic unit of both power and heat flow paths; therefore, its power consumption model can be used for both energy management and thermal management. Investigations of server power trends were carried out according to the data from the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). It is found that a heavier workload can be handled without consuming more energy, and the difference between the peak power and idle power of the servers is not consistent from generation to generation. Furthermore, the existing power consumption models are categorized as additive models, baseline power + active power (BA) models, and other models based on calculation formula and other factors. Specifically, there are four forms of BA models: linear regression models, power function models, non-linear models and polynomial models. Besides, these models have been compared in terms of accuracy. It can be found that the polynomial model and the linear regression model perform better in terms of accuracy. Additionally, the model applications are summarized. Considering server architecture upgrades and technological innovation, the establishment of the new model and its application scenarios are discussed. Moreover, in-depth and accurate power consumption models must be extensively researched and applied to effectively improve data centers, including information technology (IT) equipment and cooling equipment, in terms of overall energy performance.}

	abstract = {The energy consumption of data centers accounts for approximately 1\% of that of the world, the average power usage effectiveness is in the range of 1.4–1.6, and the associated carbon emissions account for approximately 2–4\% of the global carbon emissions. To reduce the energy consumption of data centers and promote smart, sustainable, and low-carbon city development, this study analyzes the energy conservation and emission-reduction technologies and potential decarbonization paths for data centers, compares the energy-saving situation of 20 typical data center cases, and highlights the impact of green data centers on the global carbon neutrality goal. The analysis reveals that data center energy consumption can be reduced by about 20–40\% and 15–27\% through IT equipment optimization and cooling technology improvements, respectively. Data center energy-saving strategies must consider differences in geographical location, natural resources, and economic bases. Therefore, this study examines the necessary steps for building zero-carbon data centers from the perspectives of public policy, technological innovation, and resource management. Specifically, the following aspects are explored: 1) accelerating the intelligent and unified management of data center resources; 2) building storage-computing integrated data centers that are compatible with heterogeneous resources and streamlined business models; 3) realizing large-scale and diversified use of clean energy in data centers.}

	abstract = {This paper investigates the long-term butterfly effect of cloud computing on the low-carbon economy against the dual backdrop of the digital age and carbon neutrality. Utilizing a full-sample and sub-sample approach, the study identifies the complex interrelationship between the China Cloud Computing Index (CCI) and the Low Carbon Index (LCI). The quantitative examination reveals how CCI impacts LCI – both favorably and unfavorably. The positive effects suggest that cloud computing serves as a motivator in the environmentally friendly economy. In case of negative impacts, however, it is not possible to always determine the incentive effects owing to the large amounts of energy consumption generated by cloud computing data centers. Meanwhile, the positive influence of LCI on CCI indicates how the pursuit of low carbon-economy (as a goal) will bring opportunities for the explosive growth of the cloud computing industry. Cloud computing has increasingly prompted the fluctuation of carbon emissions in the whole ecosystem. By exploring this butterfly effect, this study digs deeper into the complex interrelationship between the discussed indexes. It is expected that the study outcomes will offer meaningful recommendations for the two main vectors of economic development - greenization and digitalization.}

	abstract = {Growth in energy use has slowed owing to efficiency gains that smart policies can help maintain in the near term Data centers represent the information backbone of an increasingly digitalized world. Demand for their services has been rising rapidly (1), and data-intensive technologies such as artificial intelligence, smart and connected energy systems, distributed manufacturing systems, and autonomous vehicles promise to increase demand further (2). Given that data centers are energy-intensive enterprises, estimated to account for around 1\% of worldwide electricity use, these trends have clear implications for global energy demand and must be analyzed rigorously. Several oft-cited yet simplistic analyses claim that the energy used by the world's data centers has doubled over the past decade and that their energy use will triple or even quadruple within the next decade (3–5). Such estimates contribute to a conventional wisdom (5, 6) that as demand for data center services rises rapidly, so too must their global energy use. But such extrapolations based on recent service demand growth indicators overlook strong countervailing energy efficiency trends that have occurred in parallel (see the first figure). Here, we integrate new data from different sources that have emerged recently and suggest more modest growth in global data center energy use (see the second figure). This provides policy-makers and energy analysts a recalibrated understanding of global data center energy use, its drivers, and near-term efficiency potential.}
